# Performance Optimization Summary

## üöÄ Performance Issues Fixed

### 1. **Heavy GSAP Animations**
**Problem**: Multiple ScrollTrigger instances running simultaneously causing frame drops
**Solution**: 
- Created `useOptimizedAnimation` hook with Intersection Observer
- Implemented animation batching and cleanup
- Added reduced motion support
- Used hardware acceleration with `transform3d` and `will-change`

### 2. **Image Loading Performance**
**Problem**: Large unoptimized images causing layout shifts and slow loading
**Solution**:
- Created `OptimizedImage` component with lazy loading
- Implemented progressive image loading with placeholders
- Added image optimization with quality and size parameters
- Used Intersection Observer for viewport-based loading

### 3. **Scroll Event Performance**
**Problem**: Unthrottled scroll events causing excessive re-renders
**Solution**:
- Implemented throttling for scroll handlers (16ms = ~60fps)
- Added passive event listeners
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Debounced resize events

### 4. **Memory Leaks**
**Problem**: Animations and observers not properly cleaned up
**Solution**:
- Created `AnimationManager` singleton for centralized cleanup
- Implemented proper useEffect cleanup functions
- Added automatic cleanup on component unmount
- Used WeakMap for observer references

### 5. **Bundle Size Optimization**
**Problem**: Large JavaScript bundles affecting initial load time
**Solution**:
- Configured Vite for code splitting
- Created vendor chunks for libraries
- Optimized dependencies in vite.config.ts
- Added manual chunks for animations and UI components

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
